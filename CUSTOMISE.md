- `avatar.png` — *(add this yourself — see step 4)*

To preview locally: double-click `index.html`, or run `open index.html` in this folder.

## ✅ What's already done

- Layout, dark animated theme, responsive design (phone → 4K)
- Page order: Hero → Featured Games → Games Shipped → About + Avatar → Services → Contact
- Name set to "Moosa Bukhari" everywhere

## 📝 Remaining to customise

Open `index.html` in any text editor and use **Find** (Cmd+F) for the search terms below.

### 1. Tagline
Currently: *"Roblox games that players don't quit."*
Find `players don't quit` — change the headline if you want your own line.

### 2. Games (the main focus)
Find `<!-- game-card -->`. There are **6 cards**. For each, edit:
- `<h3>` — game title
- `<p>` — one-line description
- `<span class="game-tag">` — genre label
- The two big letters in `.game-thumb` (e.g. `ST`) — initials shown on the thumbnail
- `<div class="game-meta">` — see decision below

Delete a whole `<article class="game-card">…</article>` block to have fewer than 6.

### 3. Game card bottom line — ⚠️ DECISION NEEDED
Each card currently shows fake numbers: `18M+ visits · 320K favorites`.
Pick what to show instead and tell Claude, or edit `<div class="game-meta">` directly:
- Role / year / status — e.g. `Solo dev · 2025 · Live`
- Genre / status — e.g. `Tycoon · In Development`
- Tech / scope — e.g. `Luau · Multiplayer`
- Real visit/favorite numbers (only if they help)

### 4. Avatar render
The About section shows a placeholder panel.
1. Export a **transparent PNG** of your Roblox character (full-body render looks best)
2. Save it in this folder as exactly **`avatar.png`**
3. Refresh — it appears automatically

### 5. About section
Find `About Me`. Update:
- The heading (`Five years building…`) — your real experience
- The two paragraphs of bio
- **Quick Facts** card — find `Quick Facts`: Experience, Specialty, Availability, Response Time, Location

### 6. Skills
Find `class="skills"` — edit the `<span class="skill">` tags (8 of them).

### 7. Contact — ⚠️ PLACEHOLDERS LIVE NOW
Find `REPLACE`:
- Email — currently `your@email.com`
- Discord handle — currently `yourhandle`

### 8. Social links
Find `REPLACE social links` in the footer — set real URLs for Roblox, X, Discord, YouTube (or delete the ones you don't use).
